# Real Time Vechile Detection 

This is a simple vehicle detection project using Computer Vision..

Here I used background subtractions methods of OpenCV Library of Python and some morphological transformation for accuracy.
But this is for only static cameras. 

At the corner of the video you can see the count of the vehicles which gets recorded
when they cross a predefined limit. For the calculation of the object coordinates and object ids I defined a class called vehicles.py
